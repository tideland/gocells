// This data is passed to the cells to analyze them.

// The analysis focuses on few major fields of the coin as
// well as some feeds regarding crypto currencies. Goal is to
// see how they infuence each other. So there will be cells
// working on individual or groups of coins, others on
// feeds, individual news, and terms there.
